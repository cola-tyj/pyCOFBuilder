## Basic Usage

To create a specific COF, like `C3_BENZ_CHO_OH-C2_HDZ_NH2-HCB_A-AA`:
```python
>>> import pycofbuilder as COF

>>> c = COF.build('C3_BENZ_CHO_OH-C2_HDZ_NH2-HCB_A-AA')
C3_BENZ_CHO_OH-C2_HDZ_NH2-HCB_A-AA                            hexagonal   P    P6/m # 175    12 sym. op.
```

A `.cif` file (the defaut save format is CIF, but it can be easly changed) will be created in the `out` folder. The code will print out some information of the structure created.

Besides, the variable `c` now is a list wit two elements. The first element is a Boolean value indicating whether the network creation was successful and the second element is the name of the created network. This information can be usefull for workflows for creating multiple structures.

You can also create multiple building blocks and then construct all available COFs from the connection of those blocks.

```python
import pycofbuilder as COF

for BB1 in ['C3_BENZ_CHO_H', 'C3_BENZ_CHO_OH', 'C3_BENZ_CHO_CH3', 'C3_BENZ_CHO_F']:
	COF.Building_Block(BB1)
	
for BB2 in ['C2_BENZ_NH2_H', 'C2_BENZ_NH2_OH', 'C2_BENZ_NH2_CH3', 'C2_BENZ_NH2_F']:
	COF.Building_Block(BB2)

COF.build_all_available_COFs()

```

You should see this output, where the code will calculate how many COFs will be created and ask for confirmation. Once you type `y` to confirm, a progress bar will indicate the the creation of the structures as well as the estimated time for conclude the task. Afther the creation the code will print some informations about the COFs created, how many of the structures was created succesfully and the enlapsed time.  

```
>>> 20 COFs will be created. Do you want o proceed? Type [y] to continue.

```

All the structures created will be saved as `.cif` file on the `out`folder.  
Finally, it is possible to clean all the building blocks created

```python
>>> COF.clean_bb_list()
Deleted data\bb_lib\C2_BENZ_NH2_CH3_H.xyz
Deleted data\bb_lib\C2_BENZ_NH2_F_H.xyz
Deleted data\bb_lib\C2_BENZ_NH2_H_H.xyz
Deleted data\bb_lib\C2_BENZ_NH2_OH_H.xyz
Deleted data\bb_lib\C2_HDZ_NH2.xyz

Deleted data\bb_lib\C3_BENZ_CHO_F.xyz

## COFs and Building Blocks nomenclature

In order to ensure greater reproducibility as well as quickly and easily access to relevant information from the COFs, I've developed a simple nomenclature to name the structure. Generally speaking, a COF can be described as `Building_Block_1`-`Building_Block_2`-`Net`-`Stacking`, where:

 - `Building_Block_1`: The building block with the greater connectivity.
 - `Building_Block_2`: The building block with the smaller connectivity.
 - `Net`: The net describing the reticular structure.
 - `Stacking`: The stacking (for 2D structures) or interpenetrating degree (for 3D structures) 

To name the building blocks I also developed a set of rules. The building block can be described as `Simmetry`_`Core`_`Conector`_`RadicalGroupR1`_`RadicalGroupR1`_...
